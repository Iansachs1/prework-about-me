      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi there and welcome to my very first website! I currently work as a dog trainer but am learning to be a software developer as well. I've always been fascinated with learning about how things work and computers are no exception. I'm very excited to learn about this process and what it means for my future.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Diego, Ca</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My job is also my hobby. I love working with dogs and competing with my own dog in a dog sport called schutzhund. In my free time I also like to go backpacking, and spending time on the water either wakeboarding or fishing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>This is such a hard question to answer with just one single job. There is so much that intrigues me about the world. My current goal is to become a successful software developer and see what exciting things I can do as a result.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Ramona, Ca</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think web development is so attractive to me because it combines creativity with a deep knowledge of a very technical skill. I get extremely sucked into projects and get a lot of satisfaction out of making sure every detail is perfect, so I think I will find this job extremely rewarding.</p>
